          <p>
            With at least 5 years' experience in web design and real-world
            website projects in my portfolio to back it up, I have gradually
            morphed from a full-time graphic designer to a sought-after web and
            UI/UX designer. In the last five years, I have been commissioned by
            different clients to build e-commerce stores, online learning
            platforms, business websites and personal blogs, while also working
            on my own websites - like this one. My UI/UX tools of choice are
            Figma and Elementor (Yes, I use Elementor as a UX tool).

          <h3>Graphic Design​</h3>
          <p>
            Before I decided to become a web developer in 2021, I had been a
            professional graphic designer for over seven years. Within that
            period, I had amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience in both
            digital and print design. I went from designing beautiful social
            media banners, logos, fliers, magazines and other types of visual
            communcation materials for several startups to designing and sharing
            graphic design templates with other graphic designers on my own
            website, Pabzzy. My favorite graphic design tools are Adobe
            Illustrator, Photoshop and Canva.

          <h3>Content Creator​​</h3>        
          <p>
            I regularly publish web design
          <p>classes</p> on Skillshare and
          <p>courses</p> on Udemy. This has really improved my web design skills
          as I've had to learn how to do proper research when preparing for the
          every new content I want to create. With this discipline, my project
          completion rate has skyrocketed - I am now completing more projects
          that ever. YouTube and blog posts on my other website, Pabzzy.com.

      <p>
        Everyone has many possible futures; And in every one of those futures
        are many more possible futures; But most people condemn themselves to
        one certain future - one of regret - by not intentionally choosing the
        future they want and going for it.​

        <p>
          A website by itself is NOT an online business. An online business is
          a system of online tools that work with your website to solve users'
          problems while giving them a delightful browsing experience. In this
          e-book, you will learn how to build a self-sustaining online
          business by designing a 'digital downloads' website from scratch and
          integrating it with other FREE online business tools to form an
          automated system that serves your customers around the clock - even
          when you're asleep. It doesn't matter your industry. This practical
          e-book will help you understand how an online business system works
          by building one, and by the end, you will be able to apply the
          knowledge and build more online businesses in the future. Get the
          FREE e-book now, then thank me later :-).
