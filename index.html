          <h3>Wed Design | UI/UX Design​</h3>
          <p>
            With at least 5 years' experience in web design and real-world
            website projects in my portfolio to back it up, I have gradually
            morphed from a full-time graphic designer to a sought-after web and
            UI/UX designer. In the last five years, I have been commissioned by
            different clients to build e-commerce stores, online learning
            platforms, business websites and personal blogs, while also working
            on my own websites - like this one. My UI/UX tools of choice are
            Figma and Elementor (Yes, I use Elementor as a UX tool).

          <h3>Graphic Design​</h3>
          <p>
            I have been a graphic designer for over eight years. Within that
            period, I have amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience in both
            digital and print design. From designing stunning social media
            banners for restaurants and photography clients, to designing
            amazing logos for startups and NGOs, to designing and sharing
            templates with other graphic designers online, to posting tutorials
            and blogging regularly about graphic design, I have learned a wide
            variety of ways to solve almost any graphic design needs clients
            present to me.

          <p>
            By developing the discipline of regularly creating and posting rich
            and useful content on online platforms to help others, I have
            learned how to create different types of interactive and engaging
            content for maximum lead generation. I currently have classes on
            Skillshare and Udemy, tutorials on YouTube and blog posts on my
            other website, Pabzzy.com. Click the button to check out some of the
            online content I've created.

          Everyone has many possible futures; And in every one of those futures
          are many more possible futures; But most people condemn themselves to
          one certain future - one of regret - by not intentionally choosing the
          future they want and going for it.​

          <h3>Build your own Online Business</h3>
          <p>
            A website by itself is NOT an online business. An online business is
            a system of online tools that work with your website to solve users'
            problems while giving them a delightful browsing experience. In this
            e-book, you will learn how to build a self-sustaining online
            business by designing a 'digital downloads' website from scratch and
            integrating it with other FREE online business tools to form an
            automated system that serves your customers around the clock - even
            when you're asleep. It doesn't matter your industry. This practical
            e-book will help you understand how an online business system works
            by building one, and by the end, you will be able to apply the
            knowledge and build more online businesses in the future. Get the
            FREE e-book now, then thank me later :-).
